- 👋 Hi, I’m @mfdeck
- 👀 I’m interested in getting away from the commodified parts of the internet and not unwittingly feeding large corporations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning an Ysaye sonata for solo violin.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on naughty little misdeeds and mischiefs.
- 📫 How to reach me: perhaps carrier pigeon.
